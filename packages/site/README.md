# Merge React Components into Gatsby.js

## Pure React Components
- `/page3`: is a simple react component based page. Exported directly while not rended by react-dom.
- `/page2`: is a Gatsby page, but with SEO as a React Component imported by this(/page2) Gatsby page. 
- `theme1`: is a React Component, through a `Link` to `gatsby-theme-1`.
- `theme1a`: inherits from `page2`, but with a React component import from a gatsby theme in `packages`. 

## Notes:
1. `page3` is not a Gatsby page, so under `gatsby develop` navigating between such pages will always respond with 404. Once `build` and then under `gatsby serve` will be ok.

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-site/
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!
